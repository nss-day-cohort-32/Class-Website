At the end of 2018, I left my job as a designer to begin preparing for my education at Nashville Software School. As a student, I have embraced the attitude of constant learning and have found a career that I get excited about every day. My passion for creative problem solving still drives me forward, the only difference is, now I can find solutions using code. In my free time, you can find me hiking, mountain biking, or searching for the next cup of coffee with my wife. </p>",

As I built these projects I realized that coding took something that I already loved, science and logic, and merged it with something I was missing, creation and exploration. I became obsessed with coming up with new more complex features to add to the games and small applications I was building. I was consumed with watching my ideas come to life and become interactive.
